She also helps me see the impact I have in the world and how to leverage my community/relationships in a way that is authentic and empowering. Her genuine curiosity and drive to become better are inspiring. What Abby does best is creativity and asking the difficult questions.

Abby, I appreciate you for this conversation - for seeing the potential in my business, pulling me forward, and creating an easy path for my team to take all of the needed next steps.
