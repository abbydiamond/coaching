                            <p>"Abby is a dear friend of mine, and it's been incredible to see her evolution. She understands me at a level deeper than many of my family members. She's not afraid to explore the depths and is able to challenge the status quo of my disempowering beliefs. She also helps me see the impact I have in the world and how to leverage my community/relationships in a way that is authentic and empowering. Her genuine curiosity and drive to become better are inspiring. It's been a privilege to witness not only her growth but also how her leadership has flourished through real-world practice (designing the executive coaching curriculum at Athena, etc). What Abby does best is creativity and asking the difficult questions. She's a true testament to testing the waters and not being afraid to execute on her vision, creating something from nothing. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, I'll be more than glad to answer them. If you are seeking a coach who genuinely cares there is nobody better than AD!"</p>

Super, super helpful. I'm kind of blown away. I feel really excited and at peace at the same time. Abby, I appreciate you for this conversation - for seeing the potential in my business, pulling me forward, and creating an easy path for my team to take all of the needed next steps. You really broke the goal down into very specific action items and ongoing rituals so that my team knows exactly what they need to do. You made it so easy!"</p>

My whole career, I've been gassed up by all these coaches telling me "you can do this!" but you're the only coach who has given me realistic, strategic, practical, pragmatic focus so that what I'm building can sustain itself. Executive coaching with you created friction that allowed me to light a spark that has now spread into wildfire. It's such a feeling of excitement and incentive to create impact and lasting change in the world. Thank you!!"</p>
